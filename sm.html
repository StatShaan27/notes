            Statistical Methods is a subject that demands time, patience, and careful attention. 
            Make sure to follow your professor‚Äôs explanations closely!

            During our first two semesters, we had <b>Dr. Debasis Sengupta</b> as our professor. 
            We explored many fascinating concepts, though some topics remained less explored. 
            Here, I have compiled what we learned, along with the assignments we tackled. 
            The solutions are primarily composed by me, 
            with valuable contributions from my friend <a href="https://github.com/sagnificent" target="_blank">Sagnik Roy</a>.
        </p>

            While your course content might differ depending on your professor‚Äôs approach, 
            these resources could still serve as useful reference material. It‚Äôs always worth giving them a read!
