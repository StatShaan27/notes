        <h2>Course Overview</h2>
        <p>Statistical Methods is a subject that demands patience, dedication, and careful study. Our professor, Dr. Debasis Sengupta, guided us through various interesting aspects of statistics, though some topics were left uncovered. Here, I have compiled our notes, assignments, and solutions, many of which I worked on myself with contributions from my friend <a href="https://github.com/sagnificent">Sagnik Roy</a>. While your professors may cover different material, this collection is worth a read.</p>
        
        <h2>Books You Can Follow</h2>

            <li><a href="#">Rest of the Course - Freedman, Pisani, Perves</a></li>
            <li><a href="SOLN-FREEDMAN.pdf">Solution booklet for Freedman, Pisani, Perves</a></li>
            
        </ul>

        <h2>How We Tackled the Course</h2>
        <p>1. Every week, our professor would ask us questions based on the topics taught in the previous week. Reading the recommended books thoroughly was usually enough to prepare us.</p> 
        <p>2. Before the mid-semester exams, we had a lecture on Skewness and Kurtosis, which we briefly revisited before the end-semester exams‚Äîand that was our approach!</p>
